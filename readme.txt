== Description ==

Bootstrap Dual Listbox is a responsive dual listbox widget optimized for Twitter Bootstrap. Works on all modern browsers and on touch devices.

This plugin applies Bootstrap Dual Listbox to any select box in your post and page content. The relevant Javascript & CSS files are only loaded if the post in question includes a select box or a `[contact-form]` shortcode. 

The [Grunion Contact Form](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/) & [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/) plugins both use a the `[contact-form]` shortcode. 

If you need to force the Bootstrap Dual Listbox script & styles to load on a page, simply include `[bootstrap_duallistbox]` within the page.

1. Unzip and upload `/bootstrap-duallistbox/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Bootstrap Dual Listbox will apply to all select boxes automatically and select boxes within a `[contact-form]` shortcode
